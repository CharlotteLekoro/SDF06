### Overview
I have recreated an instagram profile page for codespace pets using css features, this allowed me to showcase applications of coding like image handling and responiveness

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: 
The layout techniques used were a challenge for me. The project seemed easy to do but wheni had to start getting to the work it became overwhelming and i didnt relly know how to even begin it. I had a lot of help and had to keep referring to the scrimba tutorial.  I am not confident in the css techniques and will definately go on to practice more.
- **Responsive Design**: 
The flexbox layout were easier to do, i had a fair understanding of the material the challeng came when putting it all together, I again had help and ended up completing the project. i will once again go and redo the project and keep practicing 
- **Styling Elements:I immediately went to style the buttons because I was realy excited when doing the button challenge in the previous weeks. it was the one thing i was really able to do without help. 

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**:
This is part of the things i thought  i understood while watching the tutorial but when it came to application i was stuck. 
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: 
The hover effects didnt present a challenge for me as i had done a lot of them during the button challenge and i am fairly confortable wth them. 
#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: Application of the flexbox and grid techniques are areas that i really need to work on
- **Code Optimization**: 
Check animation performance. Practice flexbox and grid layouts to create better responsive designs.
- **Creative Design Choices**:
